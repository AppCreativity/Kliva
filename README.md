This repository originated as feature/bug tracking of the existing Windows Phone 8 app. With the release of Windows 10, we decided to bring our app to Windows 10 and open-source the UWP (Universal Windows Platform) version of Kliva.

*If you're visiting our repository while watching the [Build 2016 session](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B818), please check out the [Alcatraz branch](https://github.com/AppCreativity/Kliva/tree/alcatraz/src/Kliva) to see what the team implemented. Note some shortcuts are taken for demo purposes. We'll bring in these awesome features in the main branch in the upcoming weeks.*

### Info
Kliva ( Swedish for to climb / to strive )

Tracking your own progress is something any sports performer likes to do!
But comparing them agains friends and foes is even more fun...

Thanks to Kliva, you'll now be able to get a detailed overview of all your sport endevaours and the data that goes with it.
Follow up on what your friends achieved and take a look at the location where it happened, maybe you can best their effort next time?

### Wiki

Do read our wiki! It contains information on what the app is all about and also what we are currently unable to do because of the use of the public Strava API

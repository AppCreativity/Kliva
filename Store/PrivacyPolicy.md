# Privacy policy

## Kliva by AppCreativity does not store following information:

### User credentials

The application uses the Strava's login page to enable users to see their own Strava data. These login credentials are entered on Strava's page and are not collected in the application. On successful login, Strava passes a unique key for the user to the application. This key enables the application to access the user's activities, but does not contain any personal information itself. 

## Kliva by AppCreativity collects the following information:

### Location

Location is used for tracking your activity when start recording. We don't use location if you're only browsing existing activities. We do not store your location for other purposes.

### Maps of activities

Kliva stores maps of your own and friends' activities to improve the performance of the application. This cache can be cleared through the application's settings.

No data is shared with other parties except for uploading the recorded activity to Strava.

This policy is subject to change without notice. Please check this page for the latest privacy policy. If you disagree with this policy, please discontinue use of the application.
